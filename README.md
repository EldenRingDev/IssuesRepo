Elden Ring (or other games) cannot be judged by mere enjoyableness of experience or its addictives. A honest reviewer has a moral/ethical duty to use all his capabilities of reasoning/logic or technical review to justly pass judgment on the game review.

**Nearly all reviewers entirely FAILED at this task.**

From strictly technical view Elden Ring **entirely fails to bring any inovation or progress in game technology, most of what it uses has already been sucesfully implemented** in GTA5(September 17, 2013) or Skyrim(November 11, 2011), so what progress has been actually made in these 11 years?

TBH i have very hard time finding any.
